# Augmentations for Ultrasound Images

This module contains implementations of the ultrasound-specific data augmentations described in the papers "Myocardial Function Imaging in Echocardiography Using Deep Learning" (Ostvik et al., 2021) and "Highlighting nerves and blood vessels for ultrasound-guided axillary nerve block procedures using neural networks" (Smistad et al., 2018).

The following augmentations are included:

- Depth attenuation (Ostvik et al., 2021)
- Gaussian shadow (Smistad et al., 2018)
- Haze artifact (Ostvik et al., 2021)
- Speckle reduction/Bilateral filter (Ostvik et al., 2021)
