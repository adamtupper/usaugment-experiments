# Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Image (MMOTU) Dataset

Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) image dataset consists of two sub-sets with two modalities, which are OTU_2d and OTU_CEUS respectively including 1469 2d ultrasound images and 170 CEUS images. On both of these two sub-sets, we provide pixel-wise semantic annotations and global-wise category annotations.
